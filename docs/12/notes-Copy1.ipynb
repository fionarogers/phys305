    "In countless real-world scenarios---ranging from medical diagnostics to fundamental physics experiments---information we already have (like the rarity of a disease or theoretical constraints on a physical parameter) can significantly shape how we interpret fresh evidence.\n",
    "By framing unknowns as probability distributions, Bayesian methods provide a coherent framework for updating those distributions whenever new observations appear, yielding a posterior that reflects all evidence, old and new.\n",

    "### Why Bayesian Reasoning Helps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Monty Hall puzzle, Monty's knowledge is crucial.\n",
    "He does not randomly open a door; he always opens a door with a goat.\n",
    "Bayesian updates naturally encode the fact that Monty's behavior provides you information.\n",
    "If Monty had opened a door randomly and happened to reveal a goat, that would yield a very different likelihood function and hence a different posterior.\n",
    "But given Monty's consistent, informed strategy, the posterior probability shifts from $(1/3,1/3,1/3)$ to $(1/3, 0, 2/3)$ for $(A, B, C)$ once door $B$ is shown to have no prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "By showing how the prior (1/3 for each door) is updated by Monty's action (likelihood depends on where the prize is and which door he opens), Bayes' Theorem makes the final distribution (1/3 vs. 2/3) transparent.\n",
    "This is precisely the essence of Bayesian inference: we begin with uniform probabilities, incorporate new evidence, and end up with a posterior distribution that strongly favors the door Monty did not open."
